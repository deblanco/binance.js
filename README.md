# binance.js
A Binance API class built under KISS principle.
Makes simple interact with Binance with a couple of methods and if the method is not implemented yet please open an issue or PR, however you could use the method *customRequest* for non implemented endpoints.

**TODO**
* Develop more native methods
* Setup an initial default config for parameters like: recvWindow, timestamp, ...
* WebSocket (long term)

# Usage
Under development... Take a look to *example.js*
